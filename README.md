## Introduction 
The primary objective of this project was to develop a virtual reality (VR) tour experience showcasing the client's facilities. This immersive tour was designed for customer engagement during upcoming events.

## Tour Experience 
The VR experience commences within a virtual representation of the client's office space. Throughout the environment, users encounter strategically placed interactive elements, represented as augmented reality (AR) arrows, allowing seamless teleportation to various key locations within the facilities. These key locations represent pivotal roles within the organization, such as the Captain's desk or the security check station.

To ensure a comfortable and intuitive experience, the VR tour offers user-friendly controls. By simply pressing a designated button on their chosen controller, users can effortlessly switch between their left and right hand for interaction within the virtual environment. Additionally, a convenient pause menu can be summoned at any point during the tour by pressing a separate button. Regardless of the user's current position, the pause menu appears conveniently in their field of view, offering options to pause the experience, adjust settings, or exit the tour entirely.

Furthermore, the VR tour seamlessly integrates with the office environment by utilizing interactive monitors. When users engage with these monitors, they are teleported to a virtual representation of the client's vessel.  Within the vessel environment, the same logic of exploration and teleportation applies. Users can navigate and explore various points of interest by interacting with strategically placed AR arrows.

* Enhanced Customer Engagement: The VR experience provides a captivating and interactive way for customers to explore the client's facilities during events.
* Improved Accessibility: The VR tour removes geographical limitations, allowing customers to experience the facilities regardless of their physical location.
* Targeted Focus: By highlighting key locations and roles, the VR tour ensures customers gain valuable insights into the client's operations.
